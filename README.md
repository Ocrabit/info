## List of Early Projects in my journey
[Utility Projects](https://github.com/Ocrabit/UtilityProjects 'Utility Projects')
<br> <i> A collection of short script utilities I create for various tasks. Includes an invert PDF script and an Apple workflow for Mac that adds a quick action called "Move to Selected Folder" in Finder. </i>

[Pokemon Prediction Data Analysis](https://github.com/Ocrabit/Pokemon-Prediction-Data 'Pokemon Prediction Data Analysis')
<br> <i> A data analysis project using principal component analysis to predict Pokémon legendary status, and logistic regression with ROC-based threshold to predict match outcomes. </i>

[Early Versions of Knit to Knit](https://github.com/Ocrabit/TestKnit 'Early Versions of Knit to Knit')
<br> <i> First implementation of the idea behind <a href="https://knittoknit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Knit to Knit</a>, built entirely with tkinter in Python. I would never recommend using python to do dynamic ui like this, as optimizing features like zooming and panning while keeping track of scale, mouse position, and pixel updates is truly a pain. But I used this to develop my early Python skills and learned to better use Python classes. </i>

[Belmont Transportation Hackathon](https://github.com/Ocrabit/Hackathon2024 'Belmont Transportation Hackathon')
<br> <i> A hackathon I did in April of 2024 where we focused on trying to find solutions to a transportation issue in Nashville TN. My role was to design interactive maps using coordinate data of bus stops and their different amenities. One of my first experience with geodata, learning to convert zipcodes from coordinates. Additionally, while not demonstrated in this notebook, we experimented with modifying geospatial files to create region segments. (something I ended up doing later on in my career contracting).</i>

[Connect Four Variation MiniMax Implementation](https://github.com/Ocrabit/Connect-Four-MiniMax-Implementation 'Connect Four Variation MiniMax Implementation')
<br> <i> An implementation of the alpha-beta pruning in a miniMax algorithm for a (slightly cursed) Connect Four variation (my brain did not compute that Connect Four is column-based and let you place pieces anywhere on a 6×7 board). Solidified some early Java skills, although I don't use Java much anymore. </i>

[Dart Board Runnable Implementation with Swing](https://github.com/Ocrabit/Dart-Board-Runnable-Implementation-with-Swing 'Dart-Board-Runnable-Implementation-with-Swing')
<br> <i> A Java project that features a pretty simple Dart Board interface (basically game pigeon rip off but much less appealing to the eye), used the Runnable lib to handle threads and implemented Swing for the UI. Has rudimentary updates to text files to keep track of histories.</i>

[Office Game Boundaries of Swing](https://github.com/Ocrabit/Office-Game-Boundaries-of-Swing 'Office-Game-Boundaries-of-Swing')
<br><i> A Java Swing project that was never finished but I loved the idea behind it. Basically it was window management, thread handling, running a game within rotating JLayered Panes, to try to have three aspect of a game running at once with the person having to cycle between and manage all of them.</i>
